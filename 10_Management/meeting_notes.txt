Architecture Review Meeting - DDR5 Controller
Date: 2024-03-20, 2:00 PM
Location: Conference Room A
Attendees: Mike (PM), Sarah (RTL), John (DV), Lisa (PD), Tom (Arch), Dave (new contractor), Jennifer (VP Eng - partial)

Mike: Okay let's get started, Jennifer has a hard stop at 2:30. Tom, can you walk us through the architecture?

Tom: Sure, so [describes architecture for 10 mins, not captured here]

Jennifer: Quick question - are we on track for October tapeout?

Mike: We're tracking to that. Some risk areas but manageable.

Jennifer: What are the risk areas?

Lisa: Timing closure is my main concern. We have 50ps margin at 800 MHz and typically we need more buffer at this stage.

Jennifer: Can we do anything about that?

Lisa: We could drop to 750 MHz which gives us more margin, but that's a customer discussion.

Tom: I don't think customer will accept 750. Let me talk to them first.

Jennifer: Okay, keep me posted on that. What else?

John: DV resources. We need another engineer. We're at 45% coverage and the ECC tests haven't started.

Jennifer: I thought we approved a hire?

Mike: We did, still in recruiting. HR says 4-6 weeks to fill.

Jennifer: That's too long. Can we get a contractor faster?

Mike: I'll check with the agency today.

Jennifer: Good. I need to run. Send me email summary by EOD. [leaves]

Mike: Okay, let's continue. Sarah, status on the read path?

Sarah: It's in progress. The ECC integration is complex. Original estimate was 2 weeks, now thinking 3.

Tom: Is that 3 weeks from now or 3 weeks total?

Sarah: 3 weeks from now. Already spent 1 week on it.

John: I need that for ECC testing. When can I expect something testable?

Sarah: Maybe end of next week I can give you basic read path without ECC. Full ECC the week after.

John: That works. I'll start with non-ECC tests.

Lisa: While we're discussing timing - Sarah, the command decoder is the critical path. Can you look at restructuring it?

Sarah: Can you send me the path? I'll take a look.

Lisa: Sent during this meeting.

Dave: Quick question - where do I find the coding guidelines?

Sarah: I'll send you the link after the meeting.

Mike: Okay, decisions we need to make:

1. Outstanding transactions - Tom recommends 48. Everyone okay with that?
[General agreement]

2. 800 MHz vs 750 MHz - Tom to discuss with customer first before we decide

3. Contractor for DV - Mike to pursue today

4. Architecture review presentation for management - Tom to prepare for next Friday

Tom: Wait, next Friday? That's tight.

Mike: Jennifer wants to see it before month end. Can you do Wednesday instead?

Tom: Thursday works better.

Mike: Okay Thursday 10 AM. I'll book it.

Sarah: One more thing - the refresh controller. The spec has three modes and I'm not sure which to prioritize.

Tom: Do all three. They're required for compliance.

Sarah: That's another week of work.

Tom: Can Dave help?

Sarah: He's still ramping. Maybe in 2 weeks.

Mike: Let's revisit next week. Anything else?

John: Just a reminder the VIP license expires in June. Need to renew or we lose access.

Mike: Add it to the risk register. I'll handle procurement.

Mike: Okay we're at time. Summary:
- 48 outstanding transactions approved
- Tom talking to customer about frequency
- Mike getting DV contractor
- Thursday 10 AM management review
- Sarah looking at critical path
- VIP license renewal needed

Thanks everyone.
