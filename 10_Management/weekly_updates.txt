Weekly Status Updates - DDR5 Controller Project
Week of: 2024-03-18

=== From Sarah (RTL Lead) ===
Made good progress on the command scheduler this week. The arbitration logic is done and passing unit tests. Had some issues with the refresh controller - the DDR5 spec is confusing about the new refresh modes. Spent a day figuring that out with Tom.

Started the read data path but it's more complex than expected with the ECC integration. Probably need another week on this. We're behind on the write path too because I had to help debug an issue on the DDR4 project (2 days lost).

Also the new contractor (Dave) started Monday. He's ramping up, assigned him the simple register block to get familiar with coding style.

Blocker: Still waiting on the updated timing parameters from PHY team. Can't finalize the training sequence without these.

=== From John (DV Lead) ===
VIP is integrated and basic tests are running. Found 3 bugs in RTL already (logged in Jira). Coverage is at 45% which is expected for this phase.

Wrote tests for command scheduling and basic read/write. Need to start the ECC tests but waiting for RTL to be ready.

Concerns: We're behind on the constrained random infrastructure. The DDR5 VIP has more features than DDR4 and it's taking time to figure out. Also need more help - one DV engineer isn't enough. When is the new hire starting?

Good news: Reused about 60% of DDR4 testbench components with minor modifications.

=== From Lisa (PD Lead) ===
Synthesis runs are producing reasonable results. Current area is 2.3 mm² which is over budget. Identified some RTL structures that are inefficient - will discuss with Sarah.

Timing is a challenge. The 800 MHz target has 50ps margin right now which is tight for early stages. Main issue is the command decoder path.

Got the PDK issue sorted finally. Missing files were from vendor FTP issue.

Need decision: Should we run at 750 MHz and buffer the interface? Would save 3 weeks of timing closure effort but impacts schedule differently.

=== From Tom (Architecture) ===
Finished PHY interface spec review with PHY team. Minor changes only - they agreed to our timing proposal.

Reviewed the outstanding transactions question. Recommending we go with 48 (compromise between Sarah's 32 and my 64). Simulations show diminishing returns above 48 for typical workloads.

Customer meeting Thursday. They're asking about the 5600 speed bin timeline. Need to manage expectations - we should focus on 4800 first.

=== Other Notes ===
- Team morale is good but people are working long hours
- Need to schedule architecture review for next week
- Conference room B is double-booked Tuesday, need to move standup
- IT is upgrading servers this weekend, may affect simulations

=== Metrics This Week ===
- RTL lines of code: 45,000 (up from 38,000)
- Tests passing: 127/142 (15 failing, 8 are known RTL issues)
- Lint warnings: 234 (down from 289)
- Coverage: 45% (target 95%)
- Bugs open: 23 (12 new, 8 closed, 3 reopened)
