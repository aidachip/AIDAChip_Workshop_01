Project Kickoff Notes - DDR5 Memory Controller
Date: 2024-01-08
Present: Mike (PM), Sarah (RTL Lead), John (DV Lead), Lisa (PD Lead), Tom (Architect)

=== Background ===
Customer needs DDR5 controller for their next-gen SoC
Must be backward compatible with DDR4
Target first silicon Q4 2024
Budget approved for 6-person team

=== High-Level Requirements ===

Performance:
- DDR5-4800 minimum (customer stretch goal: DDR5-5600)
- 64-bit interface, dual rank support
- Target bandwidth: 38.4 GB/s
- Latency: <50ns for read (first data)

Features:
- ECC support (on-die and sideband)
- Power management (all DDR5 low power states)
- Training and calibration
- RAS features (error logging, address parity)

Verification:
- UVM testbench, reuse from DDR4 project where possible
- Need protocol checker from VIP vendor (already have license)
- Coverage target: 95% functional, 90% code

Physical Design:
- 5nm process (TSMC N5)
- Target frequency: 800 MHz (2:1 ratio with DDR)
- Area budget: 2 mm² max
- Power: <500mW typical

=== Open Questions from Kickoff ===
1. Do we need PHY or just controller? Tom says controller only, PHY is separate IP
2. How many outstanding transactions? Sarah suggests 32, Tom wants 64
3. Which ECC mode takes priority? Need customer input
4. Verification: Can we get VIP in time? John to check with vendor
5. Schedule: Is Q4 realistic? Lisa concerned about timing closure at 5nm

=== Dependencies ===
- PHY team needs our timing interface spec by Feb 15
- Need PDK access (Lisa says it's delayed, maybe 2 weeks)
- Customer spec v1.2 expected next week (has clarifications)

=== Risks Discussed ===
- 5nm is new for team, learning curve expected
- DDR5 spec complexity (vs DDR4)
- VIP availability could slip schedule
- PHY interface not yet frozen

=== Immediate Next Steps ===
- Sarah: Start micro-architecture spec
- John: VIP evaluation and ordering
- Lisa: Get PDK access sorted out
- Tom: Finalize interface spec with PHY team
- Mike: Draft project plan for review next week

=== Resources ===
Confirmed:
- Sarah (RTL Lead) - 100%
- John (DV Lead) - 100%
- Lisa (PD Lead) - 50% (shared with other project)
- 2 contractors TBD

Need to hire:
- 1 senior DV engineer (John's req)
- Maybe 1 more RTL if schedule tight

=== Schedule Targets (rough) ===
- Spec freeze: Feb 2024
- RTL freeze: June 2024
- Verification complete: Aug 2024
- Synthesis/P&R: July-Sep 2024
- Tapeout: Oct 2024
- First silicon: Dec 2024

Note from Tom: These dates are aggressive. Need to track weekly.
